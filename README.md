Presentation:

My name is Jurijus Pacalovas.

Program compress not any files. I had read literature about compressions like RLE, Huffman, PI, and API. I started to think about compression further on their own and operated by the wayside 2013 year and 1 I had seen the dream about my algorithm, but was a new RLE and so how I had compression random file and this happens. RLE Algorithm: could be deleting the same information or find information. Huffman Algorithm: it is deleting long makes long smaller, e.g. Huffman 0, 10, 11. PI Algorithm: it is written information were find and the end. API compression algorithm: it takes from 1 to 348 variations. Calculus Algorithm takes 14 bits and find what does not exist and write it, also n toeed to write 1 for compress 0 when not compress or just compress like this 2^n. Need add-ones then delete them.

Algorithm init:

Mix and add 2.

Bye, bye.
